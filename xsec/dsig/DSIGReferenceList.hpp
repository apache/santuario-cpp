 * The library holds a Signature's list of references using this class.
 * Manifest lists are similarly held.  Developers can obtain the 
 * list from the Signature library using DSIGSignature::getReferenceList
 * and then iterate through each reference.
 *
 * The library also uses the List as the owner of the memory associated
 * with References.  So when a list is deleted, the references are deleted
 * at the same time.
