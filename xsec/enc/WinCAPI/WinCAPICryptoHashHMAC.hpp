/**
 * \brief Implementation of HMAC Hash functions in the Windows providers
 *
 * Uses the Windows Crypt* API functions to implement an HMAC.
 *
 * Unfortunately the Windows Crypto API does not allow callers to enter an
 * HMAC key directly.  It relies on a seed being entered into a digest
 * function that is then used to derive a key that can be used in an
 * HMAC function.
 *
 * Two types of key can therefore be used - a direct Windows key, or
 * a "standard" string as the HMAC key.  In the latter case, the HMAC
 * function is implemented internally around a standard Windows
 * hash function.  In the former case, the Windows HMAC functions are
 * used.  (The latter case is mainly for interoperability testing, where
 * the key is provided and needs to be entered "as is".
