/**
 * @defgroup crypto Cryptographic Abstraction Layer
 * <p>The interface layer between the cryptographic modules and the XML 
 * Security library.  It has been created to allow users to easily 
 * integrate other cryptographic libraries into the XML-Security 
 * library.</p>
 *
 * <p>The XML-Security-C library itself makes calls to this interface 
 * layer to perform all cryptographic procedures.  In order to 
 * instantiate the correct object (i.e. the object
 * that belongs to the correct crypto library), XSEC makes calls to 
 * the virtual class XSECCryptoProvider, which returns pointers to 
 * particular virtual class objects.</p>
 *
 * <p>The cryptographic interface has been kept as thin as possible.
 * The classes are not meant to provide a complete
 * wrapper for the cryptographic libraries involved.  The application
 * program is expected to deal directly with the chosen library.  This
 * ensures that the xml-security library can perform the functions it
 * needs to, but does not constrain the application in what it can do.</p>
 *
 * <p>Therefore, three type of methods are available on any cryptographic
 * class.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>Required</em> methods are those absolutely necessary for
 * the library to operate.  For example, these include the methods 
 * necessary for the library to decode a base64 encoded signature 
 * and validate it against a defined key.</li>
 * <li><em>Optional</em> methods are used by the ancillary classes
 * in the library.  For example, the default KeyInfoResolver can
 * use an optional method to extract a public key from a certificate.
 * This is not strictly necessary, as the calling application could
 * provide a resolver that does this work directly rather than using
 * the XSECCryptoX509 class.</li>
 * <li><em>Library Specific</em> methods are those methods that are
 * unique to a particular library.  For example, the OpenSSLCryptoX509
 * class has a Library Specific constructor that takes an OpenSSL
 * X509 structure as its argument.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Unless marked otherwise, all methods defined in the XSECCrypto*
 * classes are <em>Required</em>.</p>
 *
 * <p>The particular instantiation of XSECCryptoProvider that is to 
 * be used is set via the XSECPlatformUtils#Initialise() function 
 * call.  If no provider is passed in, the Initialise function 
 * generates an OpenSSLCryptoProvider class for use.  If OpenSSL
 * is not available under windows, the library will use the Windows
 * CAPI instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>The provider is kept in a global variable, and is used by 
 * all signature objects created by a particular application.  At 
 * this time there is no way to have different signature
 * objects use different CryptoProviders</p>
 *
 * @todo Add an ability to better handle "optional" functions.  The library 
 * should make a call to the
 * provider to see whether an optional function (e.g. extract key from 
 * X509) has been
 * provided.
