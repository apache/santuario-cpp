/**
 * @brief Interface class to provide handlers for processing different
 * encryption, signature and hashing types.
 *
 * The XENCCipher class allows users and callers to register algorithm
 * handlers for different Type URIs, as used in the various XML Signature
 * or Encryption elements.
 *
 * Default handlers are provided by the
 * library, and are used to process all algorithms defined as mandatory
 * (and many optional) within the standard.
 *
 * Users can extend this class to provide custom algorithm handlers
 * for their own classes.
 *
 * @note The library will use a single clone of any provided object for
 * a given algorithm.  So all implementation classes <b>must</b> be 
 * thread safe!
