 * @brief Interface class for resolving URIs.
 *
 * The XML Digital Signature standard makes heavy use of URIs to
 * identify information to be referenced and signed.
 *
 * The library internally handles reference URIs within the
 * document that contains the signature, but uses URIResolver
 * classes to dereference a URI into a byte stream that can
 * then be processed.
 *
 * The interface class allows others to re-implement and install
 * their own resolves according to their needs.  The basic
 * implementations found in the library are just that - very basic.
 * Enough to do the job for interoperability testing, but not
 * enough to provide robustness in a major application.
