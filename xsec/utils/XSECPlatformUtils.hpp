	 * indirection above actual cryptographic algorithms.  For example:
	 *
	 * URI = http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#tripledes-cbc
	 *
	 * is the URI for 3DES in CBC mode.  The mapper will return an
	 * algorithm handler that understands what this means in terms of
	 * IVs and how to call the XSECCryptoKey interface.  It then uses the
	 * cryptographic provider to actually perform the encryption.
	 *
	 * This allows applications to provide new algorithm types.  The
	 * mapper is used to map the type string to the means of doing the
	 * encryption, and a new XSECCryptoKey derivative can be provided
	 * to perform the actual crypo work.
