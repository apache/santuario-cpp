 * @brief Interface for SOAP Requests
 * @ingroup interfaces
 *
 * The XKMS client code needs to be able to call on a SOAP requestor
 * implementation that will handle wrapping the request in a SOAP msg
 * and transporting it to the SOAP server.  This class defines the
 * interface used by the client code to make this happen.
 *
 * Implementors need to wrap the passed in DOM document in a SOAP 1.1
 * or SOAP 1.2 msg.  E.g. (SOAP 1.2)
 * \verbatim
   <?xml version='1.0' encoding="utf-8"?>
   <env:Envelope xmlns:env="http://www.w3.org/2002/06/soap-envelope"> 
    <env:Header>
     <env:Body>
       XKMS Request Message element 
     </env:Body>
    </env:Header>
   </env:Envelope>
\endverbatim
 * 
 * SOAP implentors may want/need to add other headers.
