/**
 * @brief Interface definition for the PendingRequest elements
 *
 * The \<PendingRequest\> is used in Asynchronous processing.  A client
 * uses the PendingRequest element to request a response to a request that
 * was placed in the past, and to which the service originally provided
 * a "Pending" response - i.e. work yet to be done.
 *
 * The schema definition for PendingRequest is as follows :
 *
 * \verbatim
   <!-- PendingRequest -->
   <element name="PendingRequest" type="xkms:PendingRequestType"/>
   <complexType name="PendingRequestType">
      <complexContent>
         <extension base="xkms:RequestAbstractType">
            <attribute name="ResponseId" type="NCName" use="required"/>
         </extension>
      </complexContent>
   </complexType>
   <!-- /PendingRequest -->
\endverbatim
