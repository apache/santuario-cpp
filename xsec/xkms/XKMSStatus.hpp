/**
 * @brief Interface definition for the Status elements
 *
 * The \<Status\> Element is used in a KeyBinding message to a client
 * to provide status information for keys that are returned in a
 * ValidateResult message
 *
 * The schema definition for KeyBinding is as follows :
 *
 * \verbatim
   <!-- Status -->
   <element name="Status" type="xkms:StatusType"/>
   <complexType name="StatusType">
      <sequence>
         <element ref="xkms:ValidReason" minOccurs="0" 
               maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
         <element ref="xkms:IndeterminateReason" minOccurs="0" 
               maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
         <element ref="xkms:InvalidReason" minOccurs="0" 
               maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
      </sequence>
      <attribute name="StatusValue" type="xkms:KeyBindingStatus" 
            use="required"/>
