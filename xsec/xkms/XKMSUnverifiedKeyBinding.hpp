/**
 * @brief Interface definition for the UnverifiedKeyBinding elements
 *
 * The \<UnverifiedKeyBinding\> Element is used in a LocateResult message to 
 * provide results to a client.  Such results should be treated by the client
 * without any trust - they are literally "unverified"
 *
 * The schema definition for UnverifiedKeyBinding is as follows :
 *
 * \verbatim
   <!-- UnverifiedKeyBinding -->
   <element name="UnverifiedKeyBinding" 
         type="xkms:UnverifiedKeyBindingType"/>
   <complexType name="UnverifiedKeyBindingType">
      <complexContent>
         <extension base="xkms:KeyBindingAbstractType">
            <sequence>
               <element ref="xkms:ValidityInterval" minOccurs="0"/>
            </sequence>
         </extension>
      </complexContent>
   </complexType>
   <!-- /UnverifiedKeyBinding -->\endverbatim
